The Grid Custom Surface Projection feature is not compatible with the Unity Built-In Render Pipeline. It is designed exclusively for projects using the URP (Universal Render Pipeline) or HDRP (High Definition Render Pipeline).
To enable Custom Surface Projection for terrains or other uneven surfaces, please ensure your project is set up with either URP or HDRP and import the appropriate package.
